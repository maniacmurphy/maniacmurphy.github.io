             Automation is one of those fun words. It&#39;s one of those things every one wants but no one ever sits down and defines what that means to them. Over my career my understanding of it has changed. When I was first starting out I didn&#39;t really view my one off scripts as &quot;automation&quot;. That word was reserved for fully developed applications not the boot script I used to map printers on branch PCs. Now a days I see automation as the umbrella, much like a DBA and an Info Sec analyst both work under the IT umbrella. Around the office, I often hear &quot;automation&quot; as &quot;deployment automation&quot;. In a large scaling business, most people drift to the concerns of deployment time work. Last year I started a mission to correct that. Any time I heard some one refer to what I do as &quot;deployment automation&quot;, I would give a little rant about how the focus on deployment was all wrong. This is because deployment is only the beginning of this system&#39;s lifecycle and frankly is the easiest part of automation. But merely automating deploying of an application stack or toolset doesn&#39;t begin to tame the chaos that is Operations. Enter...

             I started this blog early last year, in a hope to make up for what I saw as a lack of public documentation around the VMware Puppet modules. For a number of years, I have enjoyed working with VMware products and when I was introduced to Puppet a few years ago I became equally fascinated. So the VMware modules are a great convergence of these interest, however, I feel it is hard for people not familiar with the vSphere APIs to get a lot out of them. The natural place to start seemed to discuss Transports since all the resources rely on them. Then was my post on the vmware-vcsa module since it boot straps the VCSA and is a smaller module. After that things got fuzzy, and I lost focus. Honestly, I might have lost a bit of interest in documenting manifests. So in 2016 I plan on mixing it up a bit. I hope to get more involved in the community in order to understand if people have a desire to use these modules and if so what they find as a hinderance. I plan on including some editorials and expand to some other work I hope to...

             The vmware-vcsa module is centered around the initial configuration of the vCenter Server Appliance. The appliance itself comes with everything installed but there is some initial configuration before the vCenter is 100% up. Note: The vmware-vcsa module currently only supports the 5.x versions of the VCSA. I am pretty sure the changes to the 6.0 VCSA module break some of these, but we will have to fix that soon so stay tuned. Getting started All these resources use the SSH transport previously discussed. Any manifest using these resources should start with creating the transport transport { ‘ssh’ : username =&gt; ‘root’, password =&gt; ‘temppassword’, server =&gt; ‘192.168.1.101’, } vcsa_eula Clearly this is used to accept the EULA for the appliance vcsa_eula { ‘accept’ : ensure =&gt; accept, transport =&gt; Transport[‘ssh’], } vcsa_db The vcsa_db resource sets the vCenter database settings. I am betting most appliances out there are just running embedded databases which is pretty simple. vcsa_db { ‘embedded_db’ : ensure =&gt; present, type =&gt; ‘embedded’, transport =&gt; Transport[‘ssh’], } I hope you are running an embedded database because while the type allows values ‘oracle’ and ‘PostgreSQL’ the provider doesn’t actually use the additional parameters that would be required to...

             Before I got involved with the VMware puppet modules, I had only been using Puppet for a few months and I had only used it to manage the system the Puppet agent was running on. But the original team behind the VMware modules was trying to manage a system that didn&#39;t run off local config files. They needed to hit a remote system where a local Puppet agent might not work, and so enter &quot;Transports.&quot; I won&#39;t dive too deep into transports as there are already some posts that do that which I shall link below. But all the VMware modules to rely heavily on some type of transport, so I would be amiss in getting started with walking you through them without at least touching on transports. So what makes a transport special? After all, I am sure that the VMware modules aren&#39;t the only ones to attempt to manage a remote system via API or some other interface. An over simplication might be a logical representation of your target system, i.e hostname and credentials. In reality they are also the entity that executes your desired state. For instance, the vSphere transport type would certainly hold the those details...

             I am sure my story is no different than most of yall. I am a technology geek that has been blessed enough to make his hobby his career, or was it making my career my hobby? In either case, I have spent my career learning from those that have come before me and I feel that I am finally able to give back in some small way. I hope this blog will help ease those getting started with some of the amazing tools out there, and to start with I am going to help introduce you to what we are doing with the VMware Puppet modules. I will try and keep each post from going too into the weeds, but if I don&#39;t explain things clearly or you have a request for me to cover a specific resource type feel free to reach out to me on twitter.

Yesterday, we updated the modules on the forge. This was long overdue and moving forward they will be kept updated.
