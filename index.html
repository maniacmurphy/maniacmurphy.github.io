             Before I got involved with the VMware puppet modules, I had only been using Puppet for a few months and I had only used it to manage the system the Puppet agent was running on. But the original team behind the VMware modules was trying to manage a system that didn&#39;t run off local config files. They needed to hit a remote system where a local Puppet agent might not work, and so enter &quot;Transports.&quot; I won&#39;t dive too deep into transports as there are already some posts that do that which I shall link below. But all the VMware modules to rely heavily on some type of transport, so I would be amiss in getting started with walking you through them without at least touching on transports. So what makes a transport special? After all, I am sure that the VMware modules aren&#39;t the only ones to attempt to manage a remote system via API or some other interface. An over simplication might be a logical representation of your target system, i.e hostname and credentials. In reality they are also the entity that executes your desired state. For instance, the vSphere transport type would certainly hold the those details...

             I am sure my story is no different than most of yall. I am a technology geek that has been blessed enough to make his hobby his career, or was it making my career my hobby? In either case, I have spent my career learning from those that have come before me and I feel that I am finally able to give back in some small way. I hope this blog will help ease those getting started with some of the amazing tools out there, and to start with I am going to help introduce you to what we are doing with the VMware Puppet modules. I will try and keep each post from going too into the weeds, but if I don&#39;t explain things clearly or you have a request for me to cover a specific resource type feel free to reach out to me on twitter.

Yesterday, we updated the modules on the forge. This was long overdue and moving forward they will be kept updated.
