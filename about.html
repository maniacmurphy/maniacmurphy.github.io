    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>Currently I work on infrastructure automation for VMware vCloud Air. I have always had the pleasure of working with individuals more experienced and more knowledgable than me. This tends to make me cranky because it serves as a constant reminder of how much more I have to learn. Luckily those more experienced individuals are also more patient and so I continue to have constant sources of differing experiences and points of view to keep me going.</p>

    <h1>About the blog</h1>
    <p>My initial focus is to help bring examples and understanding on how you can utilize the open source vmware puppet modules that I help work with on a regular basis. Over time I may grow into some ancillary post on other automation tools, but for now it will be all around puppet and the vmware modules</p>

    <h1>About layout</h1>
    <p>I like to use code to solve problems. I hate designing UI layouts which is why I am happy I was introduced to <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> for maintaining this blog and to Scott Emmons for creating the <a href="https://github.com/scotte/jekyll-clean">jekyll-clean</a> theme. I have made a few modifications but the overall bulk of the work goes to Scott and <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a></p>
