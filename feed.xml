				<title>Introduction</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I am sure my story is no different than most of yall. I am a technology geek that has been blessed enough to make his hobby his career, or was it making my career my hobby? In either case, I have spent my career learning from those that have come before me and I feel that I am finally able to give back in some small way. I hope this blog will help ease those getting started with some of the amazing tools out there, and to start with I am going to help introduce you to what we are doing with the VMware Puppet modules. I will try and keep each post from going too into the weeds, but if I don&amp;#39;t explain things clearly or you have a request for me to cover a specific resource type feel free to reach out to me on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/IcanScriptThat&quot;&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
